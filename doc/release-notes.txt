SVGMath 0.3.3-1

* Merged some improvements from github.com/w3c/svgwg repo

SVGMath 0.3.3

* Bugfixing - tapped a blatant hole in AFM parsing.


SVGMath 0.3.2

* Improved sizing of character-like stretchable operators (sum, product, etc).

* Improved configuration error handling.

* Enabled reading of non-Unicode TrueType fonts - symbols from Private Use Area 
  are (somewhat abusively) mapped to ASCII. This helps dealing with TrueType 
  fonts from Mathematica.

* Changed the shape of the radical. 

* SVGMath can now work with Jython 2.2.


SVGMath 0.3.1

* Fixed a bug in 0.3.0 - operators were incorrectly stretched in tables.


SVGMath 0.3.0

* Default behaviour of math2svg.py changed: it treats input as a compound
  document, and replaces all occurrences of MathML. To force the old
  behaviour, --standalone switch shall be used.

* Added --encoding switch to math2svg.py to set the output encoding

* Namespace-aware output generation is now the default one. Added a
  patched XMLGenerator to the package, in svgmath.tools.saxtools.

* Added ability to redefine implementation-specific defaults in the
  configuration file, using the <defaults> element.
  
* Added ability to apply additional styling to individual <mo> elements.
  Extra styling is specified in <operator-style> elements in the configuration
  file. The provided svgmath.xml makes differential operators italic.
  
* Added an XSLT stylesheet to adjust vertical position of SVGMath-generated
  images in XSL-FO documents: fo/adjustbase.xsl.
  
* Generated SVG images now contain a boilerplate text in svg:desc, 
  to discern them from other SVG images.

* Several bugs fixed.  


SVGMath 0.2.0

* Added proper treatment of surrogate pairs: one pair now counts 
  as one symbol, and gets looked up in the font directory by its 
  extended code.
  
* View box modified so that its zero Y coordinate corresponds 
  to the alphabetic baseline of the MathML expression. This should 
  permit proper alignment of rendered MathML in inline contexts.
  
* Fixed bug in math2svg.py: it displays information about missing
  files properly.


SVGMath 0.1.0
 
* Initial release
